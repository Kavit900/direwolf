Fixed things after first submission:
<br> Made sure user can't apply twice or for post-deadline jobs
<br> Delete Employer feature added
<br> Date format fixed
<br> Recommended Jobs table added
<br> Search fixed and now can be searched using title , description or field
<br> Cucumber testing added and email feature added<br><br>
Extra features:
Mail gets sent to jobseeker upon getting status change in application. (doesn't work at this point because running form VCL and need smtp server is needed)<br>
By the way according to instruction only email feature needs to be added and functionality isn't required. For code look at files named user_mailer and apply_mailer. <br>
7 rspec tests were included and verified.<br>
Bootstrap Styling Added<br>
Model tests were added and Cucumber test added.

Please review respectively if something goes wrong.

Thanks
